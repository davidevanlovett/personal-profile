import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I love software engineering and the challenge of utilizing technology to make the world a <Underlining highlight>more equitable, functional, and streamlined</Underlining> place to be.

I'm a full stack engineer and feel especially passionate about system architecture, UX design and domain modeling.

The intersection of tech and structural disadvantages are particular points of interest for me, and I'm always down to lend my skills to projects that help narrow that gap. Currently, I'm a <Underlining highlight>Product Engineer</Underlining> at <a href="https://www.simpleviewinc.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link">Simpleview, Inc</a> and an <Underlining highlight>Instructor</Underlining> at the University of Arizona's <a href="https://bootcamp.ce.arizona.edu/coding/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link">Coding Bootcamp</a>.
